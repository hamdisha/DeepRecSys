# Recommender System

Codes to buil an hybrid recommender system based on Keras.

The aim of this repository is to collect the codeto leverage a deep learning framework to create a hybrid recommender system *i.e.* a model exploiting both content and collaborative-filter data. 

The idea is to tackle issues in two different steps: first collaborative filtering and content based model separately, then a combination of the two, to get better results.

## Medium post

A somehow detailed description of the code can be found in [this medium post](https://medium.com/deep-recommender-system/a-deep-recommender-system-e2b765d27350).
